#Written by RG 09.08.2018
#This is originally generated from notation.map, after adding the missing ME for each of the different level sets in the modules version.
#The important notation are:
#All particles out-going
#Assumed 2 and 4 body-decays of gauge an higgs bosons to leptons (l^- = 99, nu_l = 98), unless photons (G=23). H3 -> l+l-G
#These entries are not important for the flavour tagging anyway
#Quark initiated lines with W attached q > qp, Q > Qp
#q flavour correspond nfB1 for B-type (so qp is from opposite generation)
#e.g. B1g0W -> [-qp,0,q,nul,l+], qflavour = nfB1
#q,Q flavour correspond nfC1,nfC2 for C-type defined for i2,i4 initiated lines(so flavour of qp, Qp from opposite generation)
#defined w.r.t C0g0[-i1qp,i2Q,-i3Qp,i4q] in outgoing frame
# IM: changed exceptional Da and Db type cases for W amplitudes so that they are not exceptions anymore
# IM: deleted H2, H3, H4 duplicates as they are not needed anymore neither here nor in the FLAVlists.


#A weird case of B0g0G named ME, which is actually a B0G0GG... (thanks KK gluons)

#A few additional exceptions are included at the end of file

#All notation should match that of the driver
